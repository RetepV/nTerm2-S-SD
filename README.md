# nTerm2-S-SD
My rendition of the uTerm2-S. In SMD, but easily solderable. In a slightly more usable form. As extra, it can switch between normal and cross (null-modem) in software.

This is a rendition of the nTerm2-S with extra PSRAM, a few extra I/O lines, and an SD card slot.

It is based on the FABGL library from Fabrizio Di Vittori.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGESS! I.E. UNLESS STATED AS WORKING, IT DOES NOT WORK!
